a simple app that lets you calculate your Body mass index(BMI).

### What is BMI?

Body mass index or BMI, is used to determine whether you are in an ideal weight range for your height.

BMI is a screening tool that can indicate whether a person is underweight or if they have a healthy weight or excess weight. If a personâ€™s BMI is outside of the healthy range, their health risks may increase significantly.
